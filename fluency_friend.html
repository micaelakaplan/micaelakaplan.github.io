      <p>Fluency Friend is a voice skill intended to help Spanish Langauge learners
      develop their ability to use basic commands. Fluency friend can help you turn
     on or off the lights, set an alarm, create calendar events, check the weather,
     get the time, and find restaurants nearby. If you ask in English, Fluency friend
     will give you the proper Spanish. Incorrect Spanish will prompt Fluency Friend to
     correct you, and proper Spanish will result in a mockup of the action </p>
      <p>Fluency Friend is hosted on both Alexa and DialogFlow, but here is shown
      with DialgoFlow's webdemo integration. The Alexa skill has the added benifit
      of SSML for Spanish, which is not supported by DialogFlow, allowing for a
    better langauge learning experience.</p>
    <p>Give Fluency Friend a try, by greeting it in English or Spanish, and then
      asking to do one of the commands above</p>
