      <p>Fluency Friend is a voice skill intended to help Spanish Langauge learners
      develop their ability to use basic commands. Fluency friend can help you turn
     on or off the lights, set an alarm, create calendar events, check the weather,
     get the time, and find restaurants nearby. If you ask in English, Fluency friend
     will give you the proper Spanish. Incorrect Spanish will prompt Fluency Friend to
     correct you, and proper Spanish will result in a mockup of the action </p>
      <p>Fluency Friend is hosted on both Alexa and DialogFlow, but Alexa skill has the added benifit
      of SSML for Spanish, which is not supported by DialogFlow, allowing for a
    better langauge learning experience.</p>
    <p>My piece of this project was the integration with Alexa, including updating the webhook,
    adding all intents and entities to Alexa's platform, and incorporating the SSML. Take a look
  at some of the demo videos below to see what Fluency Friend for Alexa can do!</p>

        <p class='jobdescription'>In this demo, we try to turn on the lights with Fluency Friend. Watch
        as an English response prompts a Spanish translation, and a correction is
      given when an incorrect Spanish command is given.</p>

        <p class='jobdescription'>Fluency Friend can also help with local discovery! When the weather prompt
        is properly executed, Fluency Friend currenlty gives a default response, but
      could one day give a real response (or the Spanish can go directly to Alexa).
    After, we ask for restaurants near by, and there is a mock up of sending restaurants
  to a linked acccount.</p>
