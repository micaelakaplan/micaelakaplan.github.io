      <p>Real Estate Bot was coded for a project in which students were given a
        mockup of housing listings in Arlington, Lexington, Belmont, Cambridge,
        and Winchester. The user can search for houses that match their critera
        for number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, or in a price rance, but
        they must specify which city they'd like to look in.</p>
      <p>Give it a try below by greeting the bot! When prompted, enter something
        like "I'm looking for a two bedroom in Arlington." Note that the email
        function is a mock up, and there is currently no integration for actual
        email</p>
