        <h2>Hi, I'm Micaela</h2>
        <p>Computational Linguist and Data Scientist</p>
        <sectionheading>About Me</sectionheading>
      </div>
      <div class="main_text">
        <p> I'm a second year Master's student at Brandeis University studying Computational Linguistics. I love looking
          at the world as a puzzle to solve and enjoy finding creative solutions to everyday problems. Language is a perfect
          puzzle because it is so closely tied to all of human interaction. I can't wait to help bring people closer
          to each other by improving the technology that they can access!</p>
        <p> When I'm not working on finding the next cool pattern in language, you might be able to find me working with
        my Girl Scout troop on their newest badge, cooking up something yummy, or planning my next trip. Maybe one day I'll
        use my linguistic training to learn to communicate with the fish I meet when I scuba dive.</p>
